# intern-feynnlabs-p1

This is code implementation for the report I written as a intern at FeynnLabs.

-> "main.py" file is the flask code for implementing web application. It contains three routes in it 1) Home route 2) Training route 3) Prediction route .Using this routing we can specify or we can use different functionality into the same python file. 

-> "logger.py" == Using this we can write logs to a topic. And they can be viwed by consumers and again they can write logs as reply.

-> "tuner.py" == Gets parameters for the algorithms we are using (Hyper Parameter Tuning).

-> "filemethods.py" == This file is used to save the model after training and to use later for predictions.

-> "Clustering.py" & "preprocessing.py" == These files are for data preprocessing which has to be done before training our model.

-> "trainingModel.py" == This is the code I used for training my model over provided dataset.

-> "index.html" == This is for user interface to display results on screen.

-> "inputfile.csv" == This is the dataset over which our model got trained.

-> The ipynb file provided to visualise the correlation among data i  google collab.
